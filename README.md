**Findings/Observations**

The causes of these strikes with airplanes were traced to some unrecognized small birds, and the number of times these birds struck airplanes amounted to 68,649 strikes.

One factor that facilitated these bird strikes is "weather condition."

*When it rained, birds struck airplanes 4,395 times.

*During fog, birds struck airplanes 1,735 times.

*When it snowed, birds struck airplanes 418 times.

*During fog and rain, birds struck airplanes 351 times.

These birds also strike at various "flight phases."

*Approach phase: when airplanes were approaching, it was recorded that bird strikes occurred 24,558 times, and 5 people got injured in total.

*Take-off phase: birds struck airplanes 14,482 times when they were taking off, and no injuries were recorded.

*Landing Roll: when airplanes were landing, bird strikes occurred 14,270 times, and 2 people recorded injuries. 

Birds strike according to states in North America

* California recorded the highest number of bird strike totaling 7,103 times.

*Texas recorded 6,043 bird strikes

*New York recorded 4.562 bird strikes 

*Florida recorded 4,077 bird strikes

*Pennsylvania recorded 3,527 bird strike and so on

**Recommendations**

Investment in advanced tracking systems and technologies should be encouraged in order to monitor these small birds around the airports.

More emphasis on bird strike awareness.

Research on measures to put in place to avoid these strikes should be encouraged.

California state, which recorded the highest number of strikes, should study other states airports with low strikes and put in place the necessary measures.
